If you're a Linux user, it should Just Work

If you're a Windows user, during install you will probably see a warning about an "Unrecognized app" and "Unknown publisher". This is expected, and we're working on removing this warning in a future version

If you're a MacOS user, we're working on getting a version out for you soon

A quick guided tour:

When you first open the application after installing, you should see a splash screen that looks like this

You'll need to select an existing node home directory or create a new one using the `Select Directory` dialog. If creating a new one, you'll need to connect your favorite wallet

Once you're in, there's one more thing of interest to call your attention to. In the top-left menu, you've got a `File > Home` button that will take you back to your homescreen when clicked (hotkey `Ctrl + H`). Very important to get back home after using an app!
